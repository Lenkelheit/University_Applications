# Solving System Of Linear Algebraic Equations In Threads And Sequentially
It is a program for testing different System of Linear Algebraic Equations (next - SLAE) in threads and without them. It allows to find out what method is the best and for what number of equations it will be good. There uses Gauss algorithm for solving SLAE.
